# Projekt Air

This project involves a compact cube made of various components to measure and display indoor air quality. More details will be provided in the different topics:

# Hardware
The following parts are needed for the construction of the project:

# Construction plan sketch

This construction plan was not implemented exactly as it is, since components have changed and experimentation was still going on with the from of the housing.

# Step 1. Function test

All components are tested for functionality and each sensor is tested individually.

# Step 2. Code customization

All components must now be controlled together in a project and connected with logic. More about this in the [Code](/Code) folder

# Step 3. Build housing

If everything works so far, the housing must be built. For this purpose Plexi glass plates are cut and holes must be left for the cables.
